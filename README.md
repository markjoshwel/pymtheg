## Installation

pymtheg requires Python 3.6.2 or later.

### From pip

```text
pip install pymtheg
```

### From main

```text
git clone https://github.com/markjoshwel/pymtheg.git
``````

You can then either use pip to install the dependencies from requirements.txt, or use Poetry instead.

### Additional Setup for Termux

This assumes you have no `$HOME/bin/termux-url-opener` script. If you do, you may have to
tailer the following instructions to work with your current setup.

This also assumes that you already have a folder named `pymtheg` in the `Movies` folder
of your internal storage, and that you have already ran `termux-setup-storage` to allow
access of your internal storage from within Termux. If not, simply adjust the script
shown below accordingly.

```text
#!/bin/bash

pymtheg $1 -d ~/storage/movies/pymtheg/
```

Alternatively, you can run the following command to obtain the script:

```text
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markjoshwel/pymtheg/main/termux-url-opener -o $HOME/bin/termux-url-opener
```

If you did not install pymtheg through pip, change `pymtheg` to the path leading to
`pymtheg.py`, such as `~/scripts/pymtheg.py`.

If you have a copy of the repo and use Poetry, change `pymtheg` to `poetry run pymtheg`.
However do add a line before the pymtheg invocation to change directories to the
repository root or else the `poetry run` invocation will fail.

Dont forget to `chmod +x` the script after writing.

## Usage

  -sda SDARGS, --sdargs SDARGS
                        args to pass to spotdl
```

As pymtheg is built around [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader), you
can pass spotDL args to pymtheg. See their documentation for more information!

### Return Codes
